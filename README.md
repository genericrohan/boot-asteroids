# Boot.Dev Guided Project - Asteroids

This code has been completed.

This project uses [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) to recreate the [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) video game.

Below are some ideas for further expansion, that they have provided:
- Add a scoring system
- Implement multiple lives and respawning
- Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
- Add acceleration to the player movement
- Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
- Add a background image
- Create different weapon types
- Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
- Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
- Add a shield power-up
- Add a speed power-up
- Add bombs that can be dropped
